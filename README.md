# Industrial Copper Modeling

## Overview

This project focuses on developing machine learning models for the copper industry to address challenges related to sales prediction and lead classification. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and creating an interactive web application using Streamlit. The goal is to provide accurate predictions of selling prices and classify leads as either "Won" or "Lost".

## Problem Statement

The copper industry faces challenges related to accurate sales predictions and lead classification. Manual prediction methods are time-consuming and may not yield optimal results due to data skewness and noise. Machine learning regression models can help predict selling prices accurately, while classification models can aid in lead classification.

## About the Data

The dataset contains information about transactions in the copper industry, including features such as quantity, customer details, item types, and selling prices. It also includes a target variable indicating the status of each transaction (Won or Lost). Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, treating outliers, and transforming skewed variables.

## Approach

1. **Data Understanding:** Identify variable types and distributions. Treat missing values and outliers. 
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, treat outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest, and transform skewed variables.
3. **EDA:** Visualize outliers and skewness. 
4. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features if applicable and drop highly correlated columns.
5. **Model Building and Evaluation:** Train and evaluate regression and classification models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. **Model GUI:** Create an interactive web application using Streamlit to input data and obtain predictions.
